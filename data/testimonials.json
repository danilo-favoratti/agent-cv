In a world where designers and developers speak different languages, his commitment and engagement made that magic happen. I can say that he masters Android development and Software Engineering like few others I have worked with. It was an immense pleasure and he is one of the coolest people I have had the opportunity to work with so far. A distinguished guy, patient, attentive, and with a lot of empathy."

Before mobility became what it is today, he was the first person I saw developing for PDAs, which at the time were quite archaic and limited. Today I don't know anyone who understands more about software development for mobile devices than him. I have always learned a lot from Danilo."
